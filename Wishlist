	- Cluster support
		(This is to allow the OS to control GPUs on systems over LAN, to accelerate game performance. We do not care about data accuracy (do not do redundant stuff), only raw data throughput. In essence, we want to throw as many GPUs at games as humanly possible, and hope developers find *some* purpose for whatever they can access.)

	- Load games in kernel mode through some sort of kernel-mode loader.
		(Avoid context switching, improve performance, maybe even allow games to directly program the hardware. For security purposes, ensure SYSTEM must be the one elevating the program, and the program doesn't know if it's actually in kernel-mode or not.)


	- Retain the 4-ring model. (Kernel, Executive, Supervisor, and User).
		- On systems where there is only 2 rings, merge Executive into Kernel and Supervisor into User. Use system calls for Supervisor to keep portable.)
