// Things to figure out:
	// Need atchitecture to support ahead-of-time compilation into the kernel.
	// But also to be unmodified and can handle being placed in a shared object which is loaded and executed at runtime.

// Solutions:
	// pre-compiled into the kernel causes us to ignore DriverExit (just never use it.)
	// Reserve 0xA000000000000000 - ???? for drivers or something. (Must be a dynamic library if not already in the kernel)
