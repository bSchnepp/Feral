[write some more sensible documentation and implement later]


LIGHTNINGSHELL:

Shell (commands are case-insensitive):
Samples:
```
	Brian | A:/Users/Brian/Documents and Settings/!> DEFINE/<flags="conceal" status="shell-only"> $HOME .  
```
Define this as a hidden definition (only visible to the same user), and only available to that current shell. 

```
	Brian | A:/Users/Brian/Games/!> run SUPERAWESOMEGAME.pro  
```
Run a program, in this example, a video game. '.pro' is for 'program'.

It's convention (but NOT required) to have commands in full uppercase, ie:

DIR
FIND
REBOOT
DEFINE

etc.

Next to the command, you can have a / and then some modifiers within two angle brackets, such as

DEFINE/<flags="conceal" status="shell-only">


Shell variables are expressed with $. It is convention to have them uppercase, but NOT necessary.
