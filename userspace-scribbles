[write some more sensible documentation and implement later]


FERAL CONTROL LANGUAGE (FCL):

Shell (commands are case-insensitive):
Samples:
```
	Brian | A:/Users/Brian/Documents and Settings/!> DEFINE /<FLAGS="conceal" STATUS="shell-only"> $HOME .  
```
Define this as a hidden definition (only visible to the same user), and only available to that current shell. 

```
	Brian | A:/Users/Brian/Games/!> run SUPERAWESOMEGAME.pro  
```
Run a program, in this example, a video game. '.pro' is for 'program', we _do_ care about file extensions, but not quite the same way as ReactOS-likes and DOS.
(We associate extensions with a default pool to associate programs with, from there we try to identify the file to find which one to use, and if that doesn't work, give up and just use a default program.)

It's convention (but NOT required) to have commands in full uppercase, ie:

DIR
FIND
REBOOT
DEFINE

etc.

Next to the command, you can have a / and then some modifiers within two angle brackets, such as

DEFINE /<FLAGS="conceal" STATUS="shell-only">


Shell variables are expressed with $. It is convention to have them uppercase, but NOT necessary.


Creating a new system-wide command (this is whitespace-insensitive, the tabs are for readbility):
	DEFINE VERB FOOBAR
	RUN A:/System/Resources/Binaries/Foo.pro
		QUALIFIER BAR
			ECHO $HOME
	END

(Then move the script defining this to A:/System/Resources/InitScripts/)
