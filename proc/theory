Split everything into an allocation for runtime within a second.

(Unless a program requests otherwise, this is what should happen)
If there are two processes on the system, then both should run every other half second.
If there are three, then every third of a second, they alternate in a loop.
If there are four, then every fourth of a second, they alternate.

When a program requests that it gets 70% of CPU time, then we should allow it to do so, then repeat the above loop for whatever is left.
We however should never allow a single process to go to 100% CPU utilization without Administrator privledges. (No game should ever really need 100% of all the available threads...)

This is done so we can allow an application to control when it should and should not be given too much or too little CPU time as it wants to.
(ie, why slow down the system running a polling loop if the game is just requesting a file and waiting for the disk controller to give it?)
