# Abstracted Thing Interface

## What is ATI?
ATI is an abstraction layer for peripheral connected to the system.
It is conceptually similar to Linux's DRM, but more general 
(more than just graphics devices).

It's primary purpose is for managing graphics devices, but also be useful
for displays, management of RGB lighting on peripherals, etc.
