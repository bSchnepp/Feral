// This directory implements a subset of UEFI 2.7.
// This is required for building the UEFI PE version of the kernel, for compatibility with
// systems in which installing a Multiboot 2 bootloader is not desirable.


#include <feral/stdtypes.h>

// Technically, we're lying, in that we really only support the bare minimum needed to
// load the kernel then leave the UEFI environment as fast as we can, but whatever.

// As Linux is with POSIX, "yes, this is a joke".
#define EFI_SPECIFICATION_MAJOR_REVISION 2
#define EFI_SPECIFICATION_MINOR_REVISION 07

// stdtypes happens to define datatypes pretty much identical to the (U)EFI spec. Perfect!
