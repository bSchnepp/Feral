Hey, at least I got a clever way to avoid naming a trademarked product...
(These are for 10-series GPUs)

We should:
	- Expect no documentation for this card to ever be released.
	- To not actually ever get (another) one. ($700 MSP, prices driven up to $800 for the consumer Ti version. :|)
	- To be behind, performance wise, to Mesa/nouveau. ( :( )
	- To create *very* buggy drivers, since really no clue what's going on with the card. (Plus there's signing images and firmware and it's a mess, no reclocking support, etc.)
	- Even if we did get a GPU to do this on, we'd probably brick at least 5, and $800 is a *lot* more than $400.
	- Basically exists because Team Green (obviously) isn't going to write drivers for every OS under the sun.
		- (Just as a stopgap solution until this project dies, or becomes big enough to be taken seriously. Whichever happens, not about some "free software purism" or anything.)
