	Things to do in order:
	Keyboard input
	In-memory filesystem
	On-disk filesystem (ext2 is enough, 8.3 FAT would be OK to also support)
	Working libc
	System call mechanism. Write a "native" driver (program under env,
	the kernel passes off to the appropriate function for the driver. Kernel
	itself only throws syscall work at drivers to do.)
	We'll eventually need Linux emulation for a "port" of LLVM/Clang, NASM,
	etc., without actually modifying the binary. (Should be unmodified.)
	We'll also want to port a JVM, golang, Python (either 2 or 3), and
	some other stuff too, just for fun.
	
	Work on being self-hosting: Feral needs to compile on Feral.
	We'll also want to create (or port) a nice desktop windowing protocol
	like X, Wayland, or just make a nice one that's specific to Waypoint.
	Likewise, we'll need to figure out how to get some NIC drivers onboard.
	Get rid of multiboot 2 stuff, eventually our own EFI bootloader.
	Write a new filesystem focusing on getting as good read speeds as
	possible on modern SSDs. At this stage, we'll want support for AHCI,
	SATA, and NVMe. Do not care about IDE/PATA.
	Write a hypervisor, and embed it in the kernel! (This will be fun!)
	Graphics drivers are pretty important to get working.
	
	Nothing older than the vega10 should be supported. There's really no
	need to: I don't have a lot of GPUs lying around, and since
	I'm really only focusing on the hardware I've got, I don't really
	have a reason to support older GPUs, especially from a different vendor.
	(Though, getting Blue GPUs to work sounds fun.)
	
	Getting version control on a Feral system would be great!
	Dogfood, dogfood, and dogfood more. If you don't dogfood, then
	you're not going to be as willing to fix it.
	
	Get a web browser going. Write a LibHTML, possibly port an open
	source ES6 engine like ChakraCore? Build one
	from scratch? At least have HTML4 support, and pretend HTML5 + CSS.
	Also, consider porting Mono.
