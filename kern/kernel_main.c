// FERAL initialization follows a few basic steps:
	/*
		The first process is always "Subsystem manager". (SSMGR.PRO), this handles dynamic linking and is essential for all non-native programs.
			(all userspace programs, unless they ship with the rest of the OS, should be a "non-native" (link with a libos) program.
			(all non-native programs inherit from this one, ala *NIX. This does the primary job of "init".)

		The second is always WAYLOGON.PRO, which should handle user authentification in all cases, even if it's for our sort-of-SMB-slash-NFS stuff.
			(this establishes a user object in the kernel and gets out some unique identifier so as to associate users with actions)

		The third is always SESSMGR.PRO, which should handle actual user sessions (created by waylogon), and handle environment variables, initialize the DCL-like shell,
		do some important stuff with devices (kind of the same as how *NIX create device files like /dev/sda, /dev/hda, /dev/disk0s1, etc.),
			We borrow DOS convention of the names (rather than *NIX-style) The names are not *exact*, only similar. 
			Note the underlying philosophy is "everything is a resource, not necessarilly a file".
			ie, \\.\Devices/CON1
			    \\.\Devices/CON2
			    \\.\Devices/CON3
			    \\.\Devices/NULL
			    \\.\Devices/COM1
			    \\.\Devices/VGA1		(even if it's actually HDMI or DP or whatever, we refer to it as a 'VGA device')
			    \\.\Devices/AUX
			    \\.\Devices/IDLE
			    \\.\Devices/KEYB1
			    \\.\Devices/MOUSE1
				(etc)

			It also assigns drive letters (the system default 'A', secondary drives get some way of assigning a letter to them, 
			(usually in alphabetical order (A:/,, B:/, ...,  AB:/, ...,  AZ:/, AAA:/, AAB:/, and so on)

/* 
	Things to do in order:
	Memory management subsystems, RAMFS filesystem
	Simple filesystem (ext2 is enough, 8.3 FAT would be OK to also support (possibly even needed).)
	Create libc, get C++/Rust stuff working on Waypoint. (We would like to make it very easy to create GUI apps for Waypoint, after all.)
	Get a stable userspace up and running. Essentially the syscall table should be similar-ish to Linux, so most assembly programs can be ported over fine.	
		Consider modifying architecture to figure out a way to have syscall tables be built by the libos...? (ie, NIX subsystem pretends to be Linux with a few Mach-isms, WINE-on-Feral pretends to be NTOS 10.0)
	Port LLVM/Clang, consider GCC/GAS port
	Port LLD, YASM, and the rest of the toolchain. Possibly port a command-line text editor, or just write one from scratch. No GUI, so FreedomEdit isn't possible.
	Dogfooding! Dogfooding! Dogfooding! Eliminate most NTOS systems on network (no longer needed), switch everything over to Feral Waypoint systems.
		(Initially we're text-only, move to a GUI, and then get networking.)

	Work on being self-hosting
	Create a generic, VESA-compatible desktop environment.
	Network driver for whatever NIC I happen to have lying around. Look for supporting whatever wifi chip is in my laptop too.
	Create a vega10 GPU driver, get Vulkan-based desktop ready. (we do not care about vega11 or vega20 just yet, primarilly because I dont have the hardware)
	We don't care about green GPUs at all. It's much too hard to support, overly complex, and no official reference drivers to peek at when lost at what to do.
	Create an alternative to the LiveCD tools we need currently, create a bootloader that understands (U)EFI. We implement UEFI ourselves, because tangling with inconsistently applied BSD license 
	is too much effort (not some easy shell script, and at that, I probably won't use bash on Waypoint, but maybe something more Virtual Memory System-y.).
	Implement Multiboot 2 support, purge old bootloader.
	New filesystem focused on getting as fast read times as possible on files (eliminate file fragmentation by not allowing fragmentation?, yes, more writes, but avoids non-sequential reads.)
			(for hard drives, specifically being sequential might actually be a bad thing because of the spinning. I wouldn't know though.)
	Add some random hypervisor capability just for fun or something (basically kvm).
	Get a working Vulkan driver for the vega10 GPU (Do some magic to port AMDVLK (is this possible?) and/or RADV or something, then just modify them as needed?).
	Port some open source games over, see if we can get it to outperform some other OSes just by running on Feral Waypoint. (specifically, everything we can from the 90s)
	We probably can't outperform Linux, but we'd better outperform DOS since game developers (at least in the 90s) LOVE DOS and would never leave DOS unless there was a *very* good graphics API elsewhere available.)
		(we're *always* 20-30 years late so we'd better catch up........). Linux tends to outperform RedmondOS (esp. CPU efficiency: TR4's 2990WX nearly double performance in many workloads) anyway.
	???

	Since we don't want to support anything older than the vega10 GPU, we should just cut out the unnecessary parts of whatever drivers we do adapt.
	(Those are too old, and by the time this becomes usable as a serious OS, those would be *long* obsolete anyway.)
	Migrate VCS server from ext4/btrfs/zfs to FeralFS. (again, dogfooding!!!!) Port FeralFS to BSD and Linux. The idea is that if it's bad, we'll fix it before bad things happen.
	
	Port mesa or get some graphics stack running atop Feral's existing driver structure, then fork Firefox and use it as system's web browser (and/or replace Gecko, move JS engine to ChakraCore, ...?).
	Hope a ReactOS compatibility layer falls out of the sky, so we can run some stuff.

//EDIT: My desktop does it too. So yeah, GRUB puts us in 40x25 for some reason.
// Options are pretty much (in order of difficulty): write a VGA driver, write a vega10 gpu driver, or beg someone with a fab to teach me electronics and design a GPU.
// So, basically for now, we have the first option, and if through some miracle I happen to learn how to mess with FPGAs and get them implemented in real hardware, that too.
// Either way, getting to a vega10 driver is more or less inevitable, it just needs to happen if we want serious support for video games (the primary purpose of Waypoint!!!)
