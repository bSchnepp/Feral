/* 
	Things to do in order:
	Memory management subsystems
	Simple filesystem (ext2 is enough, 8.3 FAT would be OK to also support (possibly even needed).)
	Create libc, get C++/Rust stuff working on Waypoint. (We would like to make it very easy to create GUI apps for Waypoint, after all.)
	Port LLVM/Clang
	Port LLD, YASM, and the rest of the toolchain. Possibly port a command-line text editor, or just write one from scratch. No GUI, so FreedomEdit isn't possible.
	Work on being self-hosting
	Create a vega10 GPU driver
	Create a desktop environment
	Create an alternative to the LiveCD tools we need currently, create a bootloader that understands (U)EFI.
	Implement Multiboot 2 support
	New filesystem focused on getting as fast read times as possible on files (eliminate file fragmentation by not allowing fragmentation?, yes, more writes, but avoids non-sequential reads.)
	Add some random hypervisor capability just for fun or something.
	Get a working Vulkan driver for the vega10 GPU (Do some magic to port AMDVLK (is this possible?) and/or RADV or something, then just modify them as needed?).
	Port some open source games over, see if we can get it to outperform some other OSes just by running on Feral Waypoint.
	???

	Since we don't want to support anything older than the vega10 GPU, we should just cut out the unnecessary parts of whatever drivers we do adapt.
	(Those are too old, and by the time this becomes usable as a serious OS, those would be *long* obsolete anyway.)

	//I don't have a TR4-compatible CPU (or motherboard) yet, so at this point I'm kind of just hoping $1500 USD just falls out of the sky or something.
	//I do expect the 1950X (as, to my knowledge, it's just a server Zen CPU with two empty areas, and on a different socket.) to act the same as the mainstream models.
	//As such, having one (just to verify it works as intended with even more threads) is unnecessary anyway. (But it would be nice for compile times...)
	//And then call KiInitializeKernel as needed. We'll also have to use SMT when we can.

	//SMP support would also be nice, but I can't really imagine any desktop motherboards supporting a dual-CPU configuration. (though this would be AWESOME! Someone PLEASE make dual-socket TR4.)
	//At best, only consoles would do it, and seeing as how console systems tend to be low on power consumption, a dual-CPU configuration seems fairly unlikely.
