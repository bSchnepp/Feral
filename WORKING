Currently working:
	- Boot (multiboot2 on x86_64 using GRUB2)
	- Printing out text w/ VGA
		- TODO:
			- _force_ into 80x25 mode
			- Figure out why that one chunk is blank on line 3 (probably a VGA plane or some code elsewhere I forgot to delete)


Important TODOs:
	- Serial driver for debugging
	- Incorporate remaining code from old Feral kernel & cleanup
	- Attempt to build on (Pure)Darwin 10.13
