Waypoint programs are associated with the extension ".way"

All programs intended to run under the Waypoint subsystem need to be in a specific format, [TODO].
This, in a game console, is similar to the concept of a disk or cartridge's ROM. The format itself is merely
an image with a filesystem which the Waypoint loader mounts, reads a few definitions, and
executes a main binary.

Each program must have it's filesystem laid out as so:

	/
		[Application_name].elf	[ELF file, executable]
		[Associated shared libraries]
		
		prms.xml				[Required permissions defined here, ie, Microphone access where needed, graphics, etc.]
		platform.xml			[Defines various platform-specific things (ie, dedicated game console, ordinary PC, phone, tablet, smart TV, watch, servers, etc.) Waypoint is for games, so generally the first 4 you'll use.]
		info.html				[HTML5 compatible (no JavaScript, CSS may be ignored) file describing this application. Waypoint loaders may only show a small subset of this file's contents.]
		saves/
			[Associated save data should be here. This is so that in the future, Waypoint can be extended to support local save backup (ie, to a 'cloud storage' service, or to a local server) automatically.]
			
		conf/
			[Associated game configuration, ie, .INI files, should be here]
			
		res/
			[Other resources. Loader assumes things like application icon, game assets, etc. are from this directory.]
			
		Applications are only required to have these inside them: Actually doing anything with them is optional, other than the .xml files, and the actual executable (and where applicable, the shared objects).
		Applications may still load system shared objects, such as libvulkan.so.1, and do not have to package them with their programs.
		The actual executable to load will be defined inside platform.xml.
