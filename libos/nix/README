This is the *NIX library which may be preloaded into applications which are identified to be expecting *NIX.

We're aiming for POSIX.1-2017 (and ideally, susv4-2018) conformance, but most importantly also to have Linux syscall compatibility.
For the odd thing that we genuinely need Feral to pretend to be an existing *NIX OS, we report ourselves as "FERALUX 5"


For uname:
___
kernel name: "Feral"
kernel release: "0.0.1"
kernel version: "Feral Waypoint 0.0.1+git[REVISION]"
