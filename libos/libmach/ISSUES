Mach was originally designed as a microkernel (everybody already knows this...), but the most
issue arises from how Mach is split up:

In version 4 of Mach, the kernel was split up into a dependent and independent part, in which
the machine-specific parts (mach4-i386, mach4-parisc, etc.) called into a "library-ified" kernel,
where some parts of the kernel may be omitted if they do not apply to that specific architecture.

In version 3 and earlier, the roles were reversed, in where the kernel calls a library-ified
set of machine-specific interfaces, and allows it to pick and choose what it should support.


The problem here is that we don't care about the underlying hardware in Feral: if it's not there,
we do software emulation to do it. Do we export these to usermode Mach applications, and
claim we're Mach 4, or do we claim we're Mach 2.5/3 and export everything?
At the end of the day, this libos exists to get gcc on Feral...
