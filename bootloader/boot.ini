; Initial timeout of 30 seconds, target disk 0 partition 1, assume it's on a feralfs filesystem.
; alternatives are 'btrfs', 'ext4', and 'ntfs', though I'm only writing for FAT (for the ESP) and feralfs. 
; For now, this file it *totally* ignored, as we assume for the VM I'm working with, it's the only OS there is.
